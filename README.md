## Project Overview
This project involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze various factors influencing survival rates and to generate a submission file for validation against a test dataset.

## File Descriptions
train.csv: Training dataset containing labeled data for model training.
test.csv: Test dataset containing passenger information for which survival predictions are to be made.
submission.csv: The final submission file with predicted survival outcomes for each passenger in the test dataset.
## Usage
Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the training data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the processed training dataset.
Prediction: Apply the trained model to the test dataset to generate survival predictions.
Submission: Create a CSV file with PassengerId and Survived columns and submit for evaluation.
## Submission File Format
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Predicted survival status (1 for survived, 0 for did not survive).
